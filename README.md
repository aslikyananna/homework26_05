Write a program that generates and prints 50 random integers, each between 3 and 6.

Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, x, and y, and computes | x âˆ’ y | /  x+y.

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except that years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. Ask the user to enter a year, and, using the // operator, determine how many leap years there have been between 1600 and that year.

A number is called a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of all of its divisors, not including the number itself. For instance, 6 is a perfect number because the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. As another example, 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7,14, 28, and 28=1+2+4+7+14. However,15 is not a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15, and 15 != 1 + 3 + 5. Write a program that finds all four of the perfect numbers that are less than 10000.
